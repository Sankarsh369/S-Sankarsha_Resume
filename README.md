I’m S. Sankarsha, a B.Tech Computer Science student at VIT Bhopal University (graduating 2027) with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My journey—from Ballari to Tirupati, Vijayawada, and now Bhopal—has shaped both my academic drive and curiosity.
I’m skilled in Python, C++, SQL, and Data Structures, and I love applying these to real-world problems. My projects range from a Face Recognition Attendance System using OpenCV to a Medicine Recommendation System that suggests diets and precautions based on symptoms. I also enjoy blending creativity with tech, building interfaces like my “Skill Spot” volunteer system.
Outside of coding, I balance life with reading, drawing, and yoga. I’m eager to grow as an AI engineer and contribute to impactful, innovative projects.
